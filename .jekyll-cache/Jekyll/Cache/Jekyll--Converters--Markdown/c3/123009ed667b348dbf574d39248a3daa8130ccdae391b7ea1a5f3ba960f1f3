I"<p>I recently attended apidays Melbourne at MCECâ€Šâ€”â€Šmy first major industry conference. The two-day event featured 5â€“6 parallel tracks with 25-minute sessions covering topics like API-Driven Digital Transformation, API Testing and Monitoring, AI for APIs, and AI and API Strategy. All speakers were industry experts, and a large hallway hosted 20â€“30 companyÂ booths.AI EverywhereUnsurprisingly, AI dominated most conversations this year. I found this somewhat curious, cause Gen AI still has reliability issuesÂ , hallucinations, context window limitations, and numerous failed implementations. From my perspective, the current human oversight required to validate AI-generated outputs makes me question its productivity gains.However, a consultant at one booth offered an interesting perspective: â€œThe API industry looked exactly like this 10 years ago. Itâ€™s better to experiment with new technologies than stand still.â€ Fair point. Though I still believe Gen AI might be more hype than production-ready business solution for many use cases right nowâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut thatâ€™s my admittedly strong personalÂ opinion.The Real Value: Conversations at theÂ BoothsWhat I enjoyed most was talking with engineers at company booths. Understanding products from a developerâ€™s perspective, rather than a consumerâ€™s, was eye-opening. I asked each booth what differentiated their product from competitors, the answers were fascinating andÂ varied.Three companies particularly impressed me:Datadog: The breadth of what they can do is remarkable (though I suspect theyâ€™ve cleverly integrated existing tools with superior visualization)Postman: Their engineersâ€™ deep technical knowledge was impressiveAuth0: Most memorable booth experienceâ€Šâ€”â€Šthey had an Electric Shock MazeÂ game!Final ThoughtsGrateful to my seniors for this opportunity. Walking away feeling genuinely motivated is the best outcome from any conference.</p>
