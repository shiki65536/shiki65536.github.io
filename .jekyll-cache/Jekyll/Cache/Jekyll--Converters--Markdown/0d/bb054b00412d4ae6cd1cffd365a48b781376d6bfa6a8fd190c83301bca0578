I"Ã<p>The CrimeÂ SceneThis week I got what seemed like a straightforward task: a transaction group error was showing up in NewRelicâ€™s unintended exceptions. The mission was clear: move it to intended exceptions, monitor the trend, and stop the Kafka Lambda from dumping stuff into theÂ DLQ.Sounds simple, right?Â Wrong.The Detective Goes Off theÂ RailsI misunderstood the problem from the start, and dove headfirst into writing NRQL queries. I wrote query after query, tweaked all sorts of conditions, and even started wondering if NewRelic configuration wasÂ buggy.The TruthÂ RevealedLater I realized: <strong>transaction content isnâ€™t supposed to be logged because of privacy and data protection!</strong>So all those NRQL acrobatics I was doing? I was literally punching air. The data was never supposed to be there in the first place, no matter how fancy my queriesÂ were.The actual solution? <strong>Modify the exception handling logic in theÂ code.</strong>Lessons LearnedThe ticket description can misleading or even be wrong. The first instinct can send you toÂ Mars.When finding using increasingly complex queries to solve a â€œsimpleâ€ problem, stop and ask: maybe this isnâ€™t a query problem atÂ all?</p>
