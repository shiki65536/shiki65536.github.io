I"Æ<p>From Zero to Deploymentâ€Šâ€”â€ŠLaunching a simple Backend Service for anÂ AppIntroductionRecently, I was tasked with deploying a backend service for a clientâ€™s app, while ensuring all necessary legal documents are in place for Apple App Store and Google Play submissions. The challenge: the project had zero budget, yet needed to be stable, secure, and compliant.Hereâ€™s how I approached it.ğŸ”§Setting up the Cloud EnvironmentI deployed the backend on a Google Cloud VM (Compute Engine) and kept the setupÂ minimal:Created a VM instance with Ubuntu, assigned a static external IP, and opened ports 80 and 443 in the firewall.Installed Node.js and configured the backend service to run on portÂ 3000.Added Nginx as a reverse proxy to route web traffic to the Node.jsÂ app.Set environment variables via GCP metadata and used PM2 to ensure automatic restart afterÂ crashes.Initially, I explored Cloudflare Tunnel for secure exposure, but it required a custom domainâ€Šâ€”â€Šnot ideal for a zero-cost setup. So instead, I used a free subdomain from a public DNS provider and pointed it directly to the VM. Finally, I enabled Letâ€™s Encrypt SSL for automated issuance and renewalÂ HTTPS.ğŸŒ 2. Exposing the ServiceÂ SecurelyTo provide a public API endpoint over HTTPS while keeping costs atÂ zero:Used a free subdomain provider to register a custom subdomain pointing to the VMâ€™sÂ IP.Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests:/api/ â†’ Node.jsÂ backend/ â†’ static pages (Landing, Privacy Policy, Terms &amp; Conditions)Obtained Letâ€™s Encrypt SSL certificates via Certbot for freeÂ HTTPS.This approach ensured the API was publicly accessible, secure, and fully compliant with Australian privacy requirements.</p>
