I recently built a side project to test a simple question for my patent translation work:Can RAG + Claude meaningfully improve Japanese → Traditional Chinese patent translation?This system integrates Claude 4.5 with RAG, optimized specifically for technical and patent-style language.Why I built itGeneric LLM translation struggles with:Domain-specific terminology (semiconductor, mechanical, etc.)Consistency across long legal documentsReusing past translation decisionsPatent translation is repetitive, structured, and context-heavy, a good fit for RAG.Tech stackFastAPI for orchestrationChroma + sentence-transformers for vector searchPostgreSQL (Supabase) for structured dataClaude Sonnet 4.5 as the translation engineDeployed and production-ready on RenderSystem highlights (in prototype)RAG over real data: 1,200+ historical JP→ZH patent translations embedded and indexedTerminology grounding: 11,000+ verified technical terms injected into promptsSection-aware translation: title, abstract, claims, and descriptions handled separatelyDeterministic output: temperature = 0 for consistencyBatch + API support: PDF/DOCX → formatted DOCX via CLI or FastAPITranslation flow (simplified)Parse patent sections from PDF/DOCXRetrieve the most similar historical translations via vector searchMatch relevant terminology from the term databaseConstruct a grounded prompt (examples + terms + source text)Translate with ClaudeOutput DOCX with metadata (confidence, examples used, terms matched)Why this mattersThis project pushed me:making LLM output predictable and reviewablereducing user toil instead of exposing complexitydesigning APIs and workflows with a real translation workflow I use weeklyWhat I learnedPlatform thinking beats model choice Most gains came from better orchestration, clear service boundaries, and deterministic behavior.Automation &gt; intelligence* Ingestion pipelines and batch processing mattered more than prompt tuning.Users shape good platformsUsing the system myself forced simpler APIs, safer defaults, and better failure modes.
