From Zero to Deployment — Launching a simple Backend Service for an AppIntroductionRecently, I was tasked with deploying a backend service for a client’s app, while ensuring all necessary legal documents are in place for Apple App Store and Google Play submissions. The challenge: the project had zero budget, yet needed to be stable, secure, and compliant.Here’s how I approached it.🔧Setting up the Cloud EnvironmentI deployed the backend on a Google Cloud VM (Compute Engine) and kept the setup minimal:Created a VM instance with Ubuntu, assigned a static external IP, and opened ports 80 and 443 in the firewall.Installed Node.js and configured the backend service to run on port 3000.Added Nginx as a reverse proxy to route web traffic to the Node.js app.Set environment variables via GCP metadata and used PM2 to ensure automatic restart after crashes.Initially, I explored Cloudflare Tunnel for secure exposure, but it required a custom domain — not ideal for a zero-cost setup. So instead, I used a free subdomain from a public DNS provider and pointed it directly to the VM. Finally, I enabled Let’s Encrypt SSL for automated issuance and renewal HTTPS.🌐 2. Exposing the Service SecurelyTo provide a public API endpoint over HTTPS while keeping costs at zero:Used a free subdomain provider to register a custom subdomain pointing to the VM’s IP.Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests:/api/ → Node.js backend/ → static pages (Landing, Privacy Policy, Terms &amp; Conditions)Obtained Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates via Certbot for free HTTPS.This approach ensured the API was publicly accessible, secure, and fully compliant with Australian privacy requirements.
