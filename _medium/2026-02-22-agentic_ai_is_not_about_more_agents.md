This week, I attended AWS’s Agentic AI Foundations training. Combining the theoretical framework with my engineering intuition, here’s how I currently think about Agentic AI.I. The Four Pillars of Agentic AI1️⃣ Planning &amp; DecompositionThe core of an agent is not generating answers, it is transforming ambiguous goals into executable steps.Chain of Thought (CoT): Explicit reasoning before actionTask Decomposition: Breaking complex tasks into micro-servicesSelf-Reflection: Reviewing and correcting outputs before finalizingThe key distinction: Not one-shot reasoning, but an iterative decision loop.2️⃣ Tool Use / Function CallingThis is the fundamental difference between an agent and a chatbot: agents have execution capability.Calling APIs (search, databases, computation, code execution)Observing tool outputsDeciding the next action based on results (closed-loop execution)An agent does not just reason, it interacts with its environment.3️⃣ Memory ManagementEfficient agents manage state instead of blindly accumulating context.Short-term memory: Current task stateLong-term memory: RAG / vector databasesThe real question is not how large the context window is.It is how we define abstraction boundaries and state compression strategies.4️⃣ Collaboration PatternsCommon architectural patterns include:Hierarchical (Orchestrator–Subagent)Sequential / Joint pipelinesSingle-agent loopRouting / ParallelizationMulti-agent is a pattern, not the definition. What truly matters:How state flowsHow errors are interceptedHow autonomy is constrainedll. Hallucination &amp; Error PropagationI have one core concern about the Orchestrator–Subagent model:Can early failure contaminate the entire system?My ConcernA sub-agent hallucinatesThe main agent treats it as factIncorrect information enters contextDownstream tasks are assigned based on false assumptionsA cascade failure emergesThis is not a single hallucination. It compounds.The training introduced an opposing view:Smaller modules → shorter inputs → more focused attentionSingle responsibility → clearer boundaries → easier validationA 100-token task is more stable than a 2000-token monolithic promptThis mirrors microservice design philosophy.I believe both perspectives are valid. But modularization without verification mechanisms can accelerate error propagation.Mature systems introduce a Verification Architecture, including:Reflection Loops: Critic / validator agentsStructured Output: JSON schema or strong typing constraintsState Rollback: Backtracking when contradictions are detectedIII. The Protocol Debate: MCP vs Native APIAnother interesting discussion is around MCP (Model Context Protocol).Advocates (AWS / Anthropic)Solves integration hellStandardizes tool and data source connectivityEnables cross-platform context sharingPositioned as a protocol layer for the agent ecosystem.Skeptics (e.g., OpenClaw community)Function calling + OpenAPI is sufficientMCP servers introduce latency and operational overheadPotential ecosystem lock-in riskThis reflects a deeper tension:Platform-first vs API-first philosophy.For small systems, APIs are enough. At ecosystem scale, some abstraction layer may be inevitable.Whether that layer is MCP remains to be seen.Conclusion: From Prompt Engineering to Control SystemsAgentic AI is pushing us from writing prompts to designing control systems.The question is not just whether the model is smarter. It is:How errors are isolatedHow state is compressedHow autonomy is governedAgentic AI increasingly looks less like a modeling problem and more like a systems engineering problem.ReferenceAwesome Agentic Patterns https://github.com/nibzard/awesome-agentic-patternsIntroducing the Model Context Protocolhttps://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocolMCP vs API: Choosing the Right Integration Approach for Enterprise Architecture in 2026https://buzzclan.com/ai/mcp-vs-api/MCPs are dead.
