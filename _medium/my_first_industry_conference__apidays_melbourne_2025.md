I recently attended apidays Melbourne at MCEC — my first major industry conference. The two-day event featured 5–6 parallel tracks with 25-minute sessions covering topics like API-Driven Digital Transformation, API Testing and Monitoring, AI for APIs, and AI and API Strategy. All speakers were industry experts, and a large hallway hosted 20–30 company booths.AI EverywhereUnsurprisingly, AI dominated most conversations this year. I found this somewhat curious, cause Gen AI still has reliability issues , hallucinations, context window limitations, and numerous failed implementations. From my perspective, the current human oversight required to validate AI-generated outputs makes me question its productivity gains.However, a consultant at one booth offered an interesting perspective: “The API industry looked exactly like this 10 years ago. It’s better to experiment with new technologies than stand still.” Fair point. Though I still believe Gen AI might be more hype than production-ready business solution for many use cases right now — but that’s my admittedly strong personal opinion.The Real Value: Conversations at the BoothsWhat I enjoyed most was talking with engineers at company booths. Understanding products from a developer’s perspective, rather than a consumer’s, was eye-opening. I asked each booth what differentiated their product from competitors, the answers were fascinating and varied.Three companies particularly impressed me:Datadog: The breadth of what they can do is remarkable (though I suspect they’ve cleverly integrated existing tools with superior visualization)Postman: Their engineers’ deep technical knowledge was impressiveAuth0: Most memorable booth experience — they had an Electric Shock Maze game!Final ThoughtsGrateful to my seniors for this opportunity. Walking away feeling genuinely motivated is the best outcome from any conference.
