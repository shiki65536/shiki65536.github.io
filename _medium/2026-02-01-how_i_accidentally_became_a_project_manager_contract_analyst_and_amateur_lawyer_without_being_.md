How I accidentally became a project manager, contract analyst, and amateur lawyer, without being paid for any of it.BackgroundI was originally brought into a project for one very simple task:Set up the server.Provide API endpoints.Done.The mobile app itself (iOS + Android), admin backend, and store publishing were handled by an external development agency under a separate contract with the client.Sounds clean, right? It wasn’t.The App That Was “Almost Ready” (For Two Years)The app was built around late 2023. Then… paused. Then… resumed. Then… paused again.Now the app needs to be published to Google Play and Apple Store. And suddenly:Google requires 12 testers for 14 daysAndroid / iOS SDKs have moved onStore compliance rules have changedThe app can’t be “uploaded directly anymore”None of this is shocking to engineers. Platforms evolve. That’s normal.What was surprising was the next part.“That’ll Be an Extra Fee”The development agency claimed:Store publishing was originally included, but because “time has passed”, it’s now out of scope. Therefore:Testing coordinationSDK upgradesCompliance checksPublishing…all require new paymentInitial quote: AUD 2,750Later “discounted” to: AUD 1,200Finally: AUD 1,000, but payment must be upfrontFor context:- The original app cost was AUD 2,000- The client had already paid in full- No new features were requested- This was purely about **getting the app live**Meanwhile, I Was… Still Just the Server GuySomewhere along the way, I became:The translator between business and devsThe person explaining Google Play and Apple Store policyThe one reading contracts line by lineThe one being asked to “push them a bit”The one asked “can you just maintain it yourself?”All while:The server had already been live for monthsEndpoints were stableMy original scope was long completedClassic accidental PM energy.Lessons Learned (a.k.a. Engineering Trauma)“Just publishing the app” is never just publishing the appIf you touch infrastructure once, people assume you own everythingContracts matter more _after_ things go wrong than beforeIf a project pauses long enough, time itself becomes a hidden stakeholderAlways define where your responsibility **ends**Especially #5.Final ThoughtI signed up to deploy a server.I did not sign up to:Negotiate commercial disputesInterpret legal languageManage offshore delivery timelinesOr explain platform policy like it’s bedtime readingYet here I am. Engineering is fun like that.
